# ASSMAN - A Simple Slaves and Master Access Network

This is created to allow a master machine to execute any type of command on the slave machines.

## Why?

I hate working on Windows. However, my work requires me to work with Windows extensively, this will help ease the pain with file transfers and running scripts.

Also a coworker needs this to control multiple computers at the same time.

## Features

There are a few features that this need to support:

- Execute a command on the slave machines
- Run multiple commands one by one (scripting)
- Auto discovery slave machines using Multicast
- Transfer file

## Documentation

Please refer to [this page]('./docs/README.md') for documentation.
